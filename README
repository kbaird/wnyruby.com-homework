For all WNYRuby.com attendees: I've tried to make directories named for the date of the meeting when each of
these projects is "due". You probably just want to grab the *_spec.rb files, and write your own base files to
satisfy the Specs.

Any questions or comments can be directed to either me or Mark Josef (mark@overnothing.com).
